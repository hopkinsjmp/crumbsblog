                <h2>Hello, I'm Carmel!</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Crumbs of Sanity, a cozy corner of the internet where academia meets the kitchen. As a PhD survivor, I found that cooking and baking became my sanctuary during the most challenging times of my academic journey.</p>

                <h2>Why "Crumbs of Sanity"?</h2>
                <p>The name came to me during a particularly stressful period of thesis writing. While everyone else was telling me to "keep it together," I found peace in letting things get a little messy – just like the inevitable crumbs that come with baking. These crumbs became my breadcrumb trail back to sanity.</p>

                <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Comforting Recipes:</strong> From quick stress-relief snacks to celebratory feast-worthy dishes</li>
                    <li><strong>Academic Life Stories:</strong> Because sometimes you need to know you're not alone</li>

                    <li><strong>Mindful Moments:</strong> Finding peace in the process of creating something delicious</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
                <p>I believe that cooking is more than just following a recipe – it's a form of self-care, a creative outlet, and sometimes, the perfect procrastination activity. Every recipe here comes with a story, because food is about more than just ingredients; it's about the moments we create and the comfort we find in the process.</p>
