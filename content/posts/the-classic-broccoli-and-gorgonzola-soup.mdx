🎓 Post-PhD • 📘 History • 😵‍💫 Indecisive

I had many ideas for my first post but, in true academic style, I overthought each one: was this one too boring, that one too complicated, or the other too pretentious as an introduction to me, my life, and what I like to eat?

On one of those days, I found myself scouring the sorry state of my fridge for leftovers that could achieve three goals:

a) be healthy(ish), so I wouldn’t end up chastising myself for both my eating choices _and_ my indecision;

b) use up ingredients in a way that felt resourceful and spared my wallet;

c) require some effort, so I could say I ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING TODAY (with visual evidence to ‘casually’ share with my husband, as proof of my natural housewife prowess).

By the end of this mission, I was staring at a bowl of food that represented everything this blog stands for: the inward places we go as (in my case, recovering) academics. So here you go. It may not be the sexiest of meals, but it’s as good a place to start as any—and sometimes, starting is our best achievement.

**N.B.** Past-their-prime ingredients are welcome here: my broccoli and gorgonzola were in a sad way, but neither seemed to affect the outcome. In fact, the hardening rind left on the remnants of my blue cheese made for added texture.
