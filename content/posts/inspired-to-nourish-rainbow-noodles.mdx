I came up with this “recipe”––although I think it barely qualifies as one––during a week when I was feeling unusually on my game. I’d been productive, full of creative ideas (the quality of which was, however, debatable), and able to point to a healthy amount of output. Nothing earth-shattering, mind you, but enough to make me feel like I was actually getting things done—which, as I’m sure I’m not alone in saying, isn’t something I can claim at the best of times. 

That streak of productivity spilled over into the rest of my life. I felt stronger at the gym, more open to trying (or retrying) things I’d usually avoid, and carved out time for proper TLC: long baths, books for pleasure, guilt-free movie afternoons, café trips, even the odd friend date. It also meant I’d been enjoying a nightly glass or two of wine—partly because I felt I’d earned it, partly because the PhD had turned me into something of a functioning alcoholic (life––and I––would be boring without at least one vice…).

So, in that headspace, I felt inspired to throw together something easy, colourful, and full of fresh, raw, nourishing ingredients—a dish that would further support my TLC streak and would counteract the slightly bad evening habit I’d fallen into (or at least, fallen harder into). The result: chewy buckwheat noodles tangled up with crunchy vegetables and finished with a bright, zingy dressing. Quick to make, endlessly adaptable, and excellent for rescuing those neglected vegetables in the fridge.

A few notes on the recipe: 

-   Scalable: I usually make this for lunch, but it works just as well as a dinner for one (or more). It also keeps relatively well in the fridge—the dressing doubles as a marinade, keeping everything flavourful—and makes a solid packed lunch.  
      
    
-   Noodles: This can be gluten-free depending on the noodles you use. True soba noodles (100% buckwheat) are GF, but some brands use wheat, so check the label. If you can’t get hold of soba noodles, don’t like them or just can’t be bothered to find them, any noodles work here—even glass noodles (just soak in boiling water). That said, I think soba’s chewiness makes this dish—just don’t overcook them or they’ll turn mushy.  
      
    
-   Substitutions: Light soy or tamari can replace dark soy (although the flavour will shift accordingly). Honey, agave syrup or coconut sugar can sub in for maple syrup; brown sugar works too, but skip white sugars—they’re too sweet and lack the caramel depth.  
      
    
-   Veg & Garnishes: The listed veg are suggestions only—use what you’ve got. For toppings, regular sesame seeds (toasted in a dry pan first) or chopped dry roasted peanuts are excellent alternatives or additions.
