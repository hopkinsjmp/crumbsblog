                    <p>ðŸ¥„ <strong>How to Contribute</strong></p>
                    <p>The intention behind Crumbs of Sanity is twofold:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>First, to share the recipes, food rituals, and quiet routines that offered moments of solace, self-care, and grounding throughout my PhDâ€”and the years that followed. These are meals that soothe in moments of struggle, offer calm when comfort is needed, and bring joy when we allow ourselves to celebrate.</li>
                        <li>Second, this blog is also a space to share and read storiesâ€”personal, imperfect, and sincereâ€”as a way to support others through the tangled experiences before, during, and beyond academic life. Itâ€™s for those who turn to cooking as a form of distraction, or as a quiet daily ritual of calm. Or maybe scrolling through food ideas is simply your preferred flavour of procrastination. This blog offers just that: a way to fill those small, stolen moments with something nourishingâ€”something that feeds more than just hunger.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If youâ€™d like to share your own crumbsâ€”recipes, stories, or reflectionsâ€”Iâ€™d love to hear from you.</p>
                    <h2>ðŸ’Œ Who Can Contribute?</h2>
                    <p>Anyone with a kind voice and something honest to share. You might be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the thick of academic life</li>
                        <li>Trying to enter it</li>
                        <li>Figuring out how to leave</li>
                        <li>Or building a life after it</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Thereâ€™s no right story or storyteller. As long as your contribution is thoughtful and respectful, itâ€™s welcome here.</p>
                    <h2>ðŸ“¬ How to Submit</h2>
                    <p>Please use the contact form in the sidebar to express your interest.</p>
                    <p>Once youâ€™ve reached out, Iâ€™ll send you a simple template to guide your contribution. Each submission should include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A short introduction (how the meal or ritual supported you)</li>
                        <li>A recipe written using the provided format</li>
                        <li>An optional photo, if youâ€™d like</li>
                    </ul>
