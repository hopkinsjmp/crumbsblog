## 🥄 How to Contribute

The intention behind Crumbs of Sanity is twofold:

- First, to share the recipes, food rituals, and quiet routines that offered moments of solace, self-care, and grounding throughout my PhD—and the years that followed. These are meals that soothe in moments of struggle, offer calm when comfort is needed, and bring joy when we allow ourselves to celebrate.
- Second, this blog is also a space to share and read stories—personal, imperfect, and sincere—as a way to support others through the tangled experiences before, during, and beyond academic life. It's for those who turn to cooking as a form of distraction, or as a quiet daily ritual of calm. Or maybe scrolling through food ideas is simply your preferred flavour of procrastination. This blog offers just that: a way to fill those small, stolen moments with something nourishing—something that feeds more than just hunger.

If you'd like to share your own crumbs—recipes, stories, or reflections—I'd love to hear from you.

## 💌 Who Can Contribute?

Anyone with a kind voice and something honest to share. You might be:

- In the thick of academic life
- Trying to enter it
- Figuring out how to leave
- Or building a life after it

There's no right story or storyteller. As long as your contribution is thoughtful and respectful, it's welcome here.
